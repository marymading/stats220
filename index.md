# About My Original Meme

**This meme was inspired by:**
1. *Struggles of a Univeristy student going through online lectures* 
2. *Spongebob because many popular memes on the web are inspired by Spongebob*
3. *The comfort and laughs from reading memes*

These inspirations led me to put together an original meme. 

## Memes are Fun!
Here is the meme I developed using R with the package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).
